This project contains a JavaScript function to simulate fetching product prices from an online store using Promises. The function `getProductPrice(productId)` mimics an asynchronous API call by using a timeout, and resolves with the product price if found, or rejects with an error if not. The script demonstrates usage for several products and handles both successful and unsuccessful lookups.
